## Description

In this exciting tutorial we are going to learn how to use a library called Chevrotain. It can be used to build parser/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple config files to full fledged programming languages. If you ever wondered how programming languages are built this video is a great introduction. We will start with an intro to lexers(tokenization), parsers, grammars and much more. Then build a simple calculator that uses all these concepts.

Other than building a simple calculator using chevrotain the concepts that we will learn here are those that are used to build programming languages like javascript, .net, SQL and much more. There is a lot to understand but this tutorial will give you an idea of further areas to explore.
